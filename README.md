# Time App

This is a simple Time App for accepting punches. This is being used for work from home days in this crazy year that is 2020. In case I look back at this and foget what was going on. There was a global pendimc konwn as COVID-19. We where told to quarantine by staying inside and if we had to go out then we had to wear a mask and sanitize everything! Then in the summer of 2020 during the COVID-19 break california alomst burnt to the ground! This made the air quality so bad that going outside for any amount of time hard to do. 

So we are all basically working from home and trying to keep track of the time became hard to do so I made this time App. 

Things to refactor:
1. Make the punches.txt file show the newest punches first 
2. Change the date format from all numbers to have the month in text like Jan/1/2021
